# Proposal 

## Name: TWC Slack AI Integration App


## IDea
- AI integreation with slack (an app on top of it) 
  - create action items automatically based on discussion, given messages 
    - prevent bobby from losing messages 
  - Sentimet analysis - how the channel is doing at that specific moment
    - whats the overall 'vibe of the channel'
      - do this by analyzing the tone of messages using llm 
  - RSS feed analyzation 
    - run on model that is familiar with what we work with at TW and automate a relevancy rating to what we are working with 

## Potential hurdles 
- confidentiality of messages 
  - would be running this through an LLM, leads to questions about what is OK and what is not
